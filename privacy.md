## 3. Data Access and Processing

The visual only interacts with the data already loaded into the Power BI report.

Message Bar does **not**:

- access external datasets  
- collect or profile personal information

All calculations (such as comparing actual values to thresholds) are performed locally within the report session.

Message Bar:

- does not send data to Doccrs Analytics  
- does not send data to Microsoft  
- does not send data to third parties  
- does not make HTTP/HTTPS requests  
- does not load external scripts, libraries, or APIs  

The visual runs fully inside the Power BI sandbox with no communication outside the client.

---

## 5. No Storage or Logging

The visual does not:

- store data on disk  
- create logs or telemetry  
- retain information after the report is closed  
- write data to external devices or services  

All data resides only in temporary memory during the active Power BI session.

## 6. Permissions

Message Bar does **not** request or require:

- user identity information  
- Azure Active Directory access  
- Power BI tenant metadata
